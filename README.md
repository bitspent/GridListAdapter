I made my custom list-adapter for a list activity, to take benefits if you are interested in.
I needed a grid that looks different from all classic ones.
I wanted two columns to load my Card Items but with no row alignment:

========= 
|	      |  =========
|	      |  |       |
|	      |  |       |
=========  |       |
=========  |       |
|       |  |       |
|       |  =========
|       |  |       |
|       |  |       | 
=========  |       |
|       |  =========
|       |  |       |
|       |
